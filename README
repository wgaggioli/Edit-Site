A Django App for a custom CMS with TinyMCE. The advantage of this app is it
provides an interface for creating and managing layouts and associated inputs
for a page. An input in this sense ranges from a textarea (displayed by default
as html page content), a list of images for a slideshow, etc. Once widget
behavior is programmed, it's simple to create multiple layouts for pages in a
site, configure the inputs necessary for those layouts, and assign them to pages
without knowing anything more than a bit of html.
